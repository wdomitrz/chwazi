//! Write the static app shell to `dist/` while the crate compiles.
//!
//! Chwazi is a browser application, so publishing it is a file write, not a
//! program run. Five of the eight shell files are committed as they are; the
//! other three are derived here:
//!
//! * `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` are rasterized from `assets/icon.svg`,
//!   which is the committed source of truth and is never replaced by a PNG.
//! * `service-worker.js` carries a `__VERSION__` placeholder standing for a
//!   cache name derived from the bytes of every other shell file, including
//!   the wasm. Deriving it here rather than per request is what makes the cache
//!   name change exactly when the app does.
//!
//! Everything goes to `dist/`, which is the whole site and the only copy of it.
//! `dist/` is gitignored, so the release gate -- which exports the candidate
//! tree -- never sees it.
//!
//! This script skips the wasm target entirely. During
//! `cargo build --lib --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` the `dist/` artefacts
//! are the *output* of that build: `app.js` and `app_bg.wasm` do not exist
//! yet, so publishing the site there would fail on the very step that produces
//! them. The host build that follows the wasm-bindgen pass is the one that
//! publishes.
